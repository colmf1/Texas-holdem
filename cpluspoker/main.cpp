// Step1:
// Implement a deck class, with shuffle and deal methods.
// Deck is made up of cards 
// I think I make a card class first, then maybe hide it in deck later.
// A card is a struct 
// No it isn't because I want to print it 
// Nevermind, I can just make a function that takes a card



// No idea about anything, work my way through, dont touch cpp folder or clankers.
// This version will track gamestate.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    struct card {
        // Abandoning chars because im bad at coding
        int value;
        int suit;
    };

    // Face 1-4
    // Suit 

    for(int i; i=0; i<52) {
        std::cout << i << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
